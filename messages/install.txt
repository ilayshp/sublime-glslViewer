Installation
------------

This plugin uses a third-party application glslViewer for rendering the fragment shaders. Please don't forget to install it first. 

To install glslViewer, go to https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer and follow the instructions.

Note: By default will be installed on ```/usr/local/bin``` if that's not the case edit it the ```glslViewer.sublime-settings``` file.

Usage
-----

This package also installs `OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)` that defines `source.glsl` so, if you have Automatic Build System turned On, you can lanch glslViewer with Command + B (macOS) or Control + B (on Linux).
